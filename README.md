# Prismic toolbar
The prismic toolbar is integrated to your website for:
 - Preview unpublished changes (drafts and releases)
 - Edit button: easy access to the corresponding document in the Prismic Backend.
 - A/B testing (experiments)

## How to use it?
There are two ways to use it:
- As a standalone, if rendering is done server side just include the CDN file:
```https://unpkg.com/prismic-toolbar/dist/prismic-toolbar.min.js```
- Integrated in a client-side application: 
```npm install prismic-toolbar --save```

If you need to support [browsers which don't implement the `fetch` API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch)
you will probably also want to include a [polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch).
